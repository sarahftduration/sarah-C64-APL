# APL for the Commodore 64: design notes

Living spec. `apl64.py` is the executable reference model; where this file
and the model disagree, the model wins and this file has a bug.

## Goals and scope

- Self-hosted, interactive APL on a stock C64 (6510, ~1 MHz, 64 KB).
- A **tokenizing interpreter** (like BASIC), not a native-code compiler.
  APL is dynamically typed and array-shaped, so compiled code would mostly
  be calls into a runtime and would cost RAM for little speedup.
- Cross-developed on a modern machine; it does not need to be *built* on the C64.
- 6502 assembly runtime, tested differentially against the Python model.

## Memory plan (with BASIC ROM banked out via $01)

Roughly $0801-$CFFF (about 50 KB) usable. KERNAL stays enabled for keyboard
scanning and disk I/O (`)SAVE` / `)LOAD` are KERNAL calls).

- Runtime code at the bottom (about 12-16 KB when done)
- Symbol table and tokenized function bodies above it
- Array heap grows up, value stack grows down from the top
- Heap uses a **handle table** (one slot per array, 2 bytes) and a
  **mark-compact GC**; compaction updates one pointer per array.

## Element types (homogeneous arrays, no mixing)

| Tag | Type  | Bytes | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| 0   | BOOL  | 1     | 0 or 1, one byte per element (no bit packing yet) |
| 1   | CHAR  | 1     | code into the custom charset |
| 2   | INT   | 2     | signed 16-bit, little-endian |
| 3   | FLOAT | 3     | float24, below |

Mixing types in one array (`1 'a'`, `'a',1`) is a DOMAIN ERROR. Numeric
types widen along BOOL -> INT -> FLOAT. CHAR never mixes with numbers.
An empty vector keeps its type (`''` is CHAR, `⍬` is INT); in catenate an
empty operand adopts the other operand's type.

## float24

```
byte 0: exponent, excess-128, 0 means the value zero
byte 1: sign bit | top 7 bits of the stored fraction
byte 2: low 8 bits of the stored fraction
value = (-1)^s * (0x8000 | fraction15) / 2^16 * 2^(exp-128)
```

- 16-bit significand (hidden leading 1), about 4.8 decimal digits.
- Range about 1.5e-39 to 1.7e38. Every int16 is exact.
- + - x / are **correctly rounded, round-to-nearest-even** (6502: guard,
  round and sticky bits). Underflow flushes to zero. Overflow is DOMAIN ERROR.
  No NaN, no Inf, no negative zero.
- Ordering: `(exp<<16 | fraction)` is monotonic in magnitude, so exact
  compare is a sign-magnitude compare of the raw bytes.
- Comparison tolerance (floats only; int/int is exact):
  `a = b` iff `a == b`, or `a - b == 0`, or
  `exp(a-b) <= max(exp(a), exp(b)) - 14`.
  `< <= > >=` apply that test first, then compare exactly.
  0 is never tolerantly equal to a nonzero value.
- **Print precision (⎕PP) defaults to 4**, not 5: 10^4 < 2^15, so a 4-digit
  decimal always survives parse -> float24 -> print. At 5 digits the noise
  shows (0.001 prints as 0.00099999). Whole-valued floats up to 65536 print
  exactly.
- Parse and print use a table of powers of ten. They are **not** required to
  be bit-exact against the model (1 ulp allowed); everything else is.

## Arithmetic rules

- `+ - ×` on BOOL/INT run in int16 optimistically. If **any** result element
  leaves int16, the whole primitive is redone in float24. (6502: the V flag
  catches add/sub overflow; for multiply, check whether the upper bytes of the
  32-bit product are just sign extension.)
- `÷` always yields FLOAT. `0÷0` is 1; `x÷0` is DOMAIN ERROR.
- Comparisons yield BOOL. CHAR supports only `=` and `≠` (char vs number is
  0 / 1, not an error); other CHAR arithmetic or ordering is DOMAIN ERROR.
- Scalar extension only (a scalar with an array); otherwise RANK ERROR or
  LENGTH ERROR.
- `f/` reduces right to left (`-/1 2 3` is 2). `+/` accumulates **exactly and
  rounds once**. Empty reduce returns the identity (+ 0, - 0, × 1, ÷ 1,
  = 1, ≠ 0, < 0, ≤ 1, > 0, ≥ 1). Reduce on a matrix works along the last axis.
- `⍳n` is INT, origin 1 (⎕IO=1). `⍴` monadic gives an INT shape vector;
  dyadic reshape cycles data and fills an empty right argument with 0 or space.
- Arrays are limited to `WS_BYTES` (45000 in the model) and 65535 elements:
  WS FULL.

## Heap array layout (also the literal body in the token stream)

```
byte 0:    type (bits 0-1) | rank (bits 2-3)
bytes 1-2: element count, 16-bit little-endian
then 2 bytes (little-endian) per axis, rank <= 2
then the data, element width from the type
```

INT is two's complement little-endian. FLOAT is the three bytes above in
order (exp, sign|hi7, lo8).

## Value stack cells (planned; not in the Python model)

Fixed **4-byte cells**: a type byte plus 3 payload bytes. A scalar lives
entirely in the cell, so scalar-heavy code never touches the allocator or GC.
Arrays put a heap handle in the payload.

## Token stream

One line ends with `$00`.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `$00` | End of line |
| `$01` | Literal, followed by an array body (layout above) |
| `$02` | Name, followed by a 1-byte symbol index (max 256 names) |
| `$03-$0A` | `(  )  [  ]  ←  →  ⋄  ;` |
| `$10-$7F` | Reserved (system functions, ⎕ names, control keywords) |
| `$80+i` | Primitive function, `i` indexes `+-×÷=≠<≤>≥⍳⍴,` |
| `$C0+i` | Operator, `i` indexes `/\¨.∘⍤` |

- Number strands and strings are folded into **one literal** by the tokenizer.
  Narrowest type wins: all 0/1 is BOOL; all whole numbers in int16 is INT;
  anything else is FLOAT. Adjacent numeric and character literals are a
  DOMAIN ERROR at tokenize time.
- One token per glyph. The evaluator decides monadic or dyadic from the left
  context, and looks up the pair in the primitive table.
- Comments (`⍝`) are stripped on entry. If we want to keep them for function
  listing, store them as a `$10` token that the evaluator skips.
- Negative numbers use `¯` inside numeric literals. `-` is always the function.

## Evaluator

No parse tree. Scan tokens right to left:

1. The rightmost token must be a value (literal, name, or a parenthesized
   expression, which is evaluated recursively).
2. Loop on the token to the left:
   - `←` with a name immediately before it: assign, continue leftward
   - a function: if a value is immediately to its left it is dyadic, otherwise
     monadic
   - an operator takes the primitive immediately to its left as its operand
     and the result is a derived function (only `/` on scalar dyadic
     primitives is implemented)
   - anything else is a SYNTAX ERROR
3. `⋄` splits statements. A statement whose leftmost tokens are `name ←` is
   not echoed.

## Errors

`DOMAIN ERROR, LENGTH ERROR, RANK ERROR, SYNTAX ERROR, VALUE ERROR,
NONCE ERROR (not implemented), LIMIT ERROR, WS FULL`

## Testing strategy

1. `apl64.py` is the executable spec (`python3 apl64.py --test`).
2. 6502 primitives are assembled and run headless under **py65**.
3. Differential tests: random operands through both, compare the raw bytes
   (type, shape, data). Any difference is a real bug, apart from decimal
   parse and print (1 ulp allowed).
4. **VICE** for final integration: custom charset, screen output, `.prg`
   loading, disk I/O.

## Display and input (planned)

- 40x25 text screen; matrices need column-aware output formatting.
- Custom 2 KB APL character set in RAM, selected via `$D018`.
- Keyboard: Commodore/Shift-modified keys for common glyphs plus a two-key
  digraph fallback.

## Implemented in the model so far

`+ - × ÷` (monadic: identity, negate, signum, reciprocal), `= ≠ < ≤ > ≥`,
`⍳`, `⍴` (monadic and dyadic), `,` (ravel, and catenate on vectors),
`f/` for scalar dyadic `f`, assignment, `( )`, `⋄`, `⍬`.

NONCE: `\ ¨ . ∘ ⍤`, replicate (`n/x`), indexing `[ ]`, branch `→`, `;`,
catenate on matrices, index-of (dyadic `⍳`), user-defined functions.

## Next steps

1. 6502: float24 unpack / add / pack, diffed against `f_add` under py65.
2. 6502: `f_mul`, `f_div`, int16 add/sub with overflow redo.
3. 6502: evaluator loop, handle heap, GC.
4. Model: matrix catenate, indexing, `∘.`, `\`, user functions, control flow.
5. Charset, keyboard entry, `)SAVE` / `)LOAD`.
6. Later options: bit-packed BOOL, 4-byte float, transcendentals, fusion of
   scalar pipelines (e.g. `+/A×B` in one loop).
